                In addition to his role in INIDUN, Norén works in the research project Welfare State Analytics (WeStAc), funded by the Swedish
                Research Council (2019–2023), which will text mine and model Swedish politics, media and culture between 1945 and 1989.
                The project will digitise literature, curate already digitised collections, and perform research via probabilistic methods
                and text mining models. Given WeStAc’s combination of general and particular research questions, the project will give
                new perspectives on well-researched topics and explore novel ways of analysing historical Big Data.
