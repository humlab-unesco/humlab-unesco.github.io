Can intellectual history’s digital and global turns be brought together in a way that benefits both?

A short piece of mine, on how the INIDUN project seeks to address this question, is now up on the [blog of the Uppsala University Digital Humanities network](https://digitalhumanities.blogg.uu.se/2020/12/17/a-digital-approach-to-global-intellectual-history-text-mining-unesco/). 

Thanks to Matts Lindström for the invitation to present our project there!
